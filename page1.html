        <h2 class="topRopeTitle">Top Roping</h2>
        <p class="topRope">
                Top roping is where I started climbing and what I thought
            people meant by 'rock climbing' when I heard the phrase.
            Top roping is where a rope is attached to the top of a
            large wall and someone at the bottom belays to make sure
            you don't fall far.
            I had top roped a few times before when I was a kid and
            only one or two times as an adult before earlier this year
            (2022). I had always liked it, but never found a partner
            to go consistently with until my friend Tyler said that he
            started going and I asked to come along one time. We had not
            top roped before and had to complete a test to prove that we
            could belay for each other. so we found a video on youtube
            and tried to learn that way. After a while we attempted the
            test and the person administering it, whose name was Donna,
            knew we didn't really know what we were doing. A few attempts
            later she taught us how and with a little practice we figured
            it out. After that, Tyler and I spent close to an hour trying
            to climb walls and figuring out which ones we could actually
            complete. The hardest one I could do on that day was a 5.10B,
            which is not a high rating, but it felt difficult at the time.
            The whole experience was very enjoyable and we made it a weekly
            thing. We have taken a couple breaks in the several months that
            we have been climbing for various reasons, but we still go climbing
            together pretty regularly.

        <h2 class="boulderTitle">Bouldering</h2>
        <p class="boulder">
            Bouldering is different than top roping in that the walls are
            much lower and you don't need a partner to belay for you.
            Tyler and I would occasionally boulder for short times during our
            sessions, but since top roping is an
            activity that requires two people, most of the time we find
            ourselves doing that. Outside of those times I would find myself
            wanting to climb with not partner, so I would go to the gym and
            boulder for an hour or so a couple times a week. There was a month
            or so that I would go three to four times a week. I loved bouldering
            by myself, as I could just listen to music and try to finish routes
            that were challenging and required many attempts. I improved a decent
            amount to the point where I could do some v4s, but then I hit a wall.
            A month or so later, I was still stuck climbing v4s and I lost quite
            a bit of motivation to go. I would still go once a week with Tyler, but
            I didn't feel the same motivation to go by myself. Then I started to
            get my family to come with me.

        <h2 class="joinTitle">Getting Others to Join</h2>
        <p class="join">
            A few months ago I started to get my family to come along with me and
            try rock climbing. I started with my brother because I had been talking
            about it for a while and he had expressed some interest in going. So we
            went bouldering a couple times and he liked going with me. After a few
            times we made it an almost weekly occurance, just like I had with Tyler.
            This helped me get some of the motivation back to go and improve. I still
            go with my brother every week and have tried to get other people to come
            with me. I have succeeded in getting my fiance, and my dad to join me once,
            but I'm always looking for more people to go with.
